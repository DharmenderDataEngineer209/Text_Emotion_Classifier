## Emotion Detection with Deep Learning

    This project focuses on emotion detection from text. Using deep learning, the model identifies emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and fear from user inputs. It's all about teaching machines
    to understand human emotions.

# Features

# Text Preprocessing:

        Tokenized text into sequences.
        Padded sequences for uniform input size.
        Encoded emotions into one-hot labels.

# Model Architecture:

        Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors.
        Flatten Layer: Flattens the output for the dense layer.
        Dense Layers: Includes a ReLU layer for feature extraction and a
        softmax layer for multi-class emotion classification.

# Training & Evaluation:

        Achieved high accuracy through Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

# Machine Learning Concepts

    Tokenizer and Padding: Converts text into numerical sequences for model input. Ensures all sequences have the same length.

    Label Encoding: Maps textual labels (e.g., "joy") to numeric values. Essential for model compatibility.

    Softmax Activation: Transforms output into probabilities. Helps in multi-class classification.
